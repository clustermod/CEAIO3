# Reporting an issue

## Before reporting

If you have found an issue with CE:M please make sure that CE:M really is the cause of the problem. To do this try to reproduce the issue with using only `CE:M` on a newly created mission.

Indicate if the issue appears on stable or development version. In case it is the development version, please also include the commit SHA-1 hash.

**Please note:**
- It's not a valid to simply remove <code>CE:M</code> from the mission to confirm that CE:M is the culprit.
- If the error happens when using a <b>third-party script or framework</b> contact the author of the appropriate mod and report the issue there.

## Reporting the issue

Head over to the [CE:M GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/clustermod/CEM3/issues) and press the [New issue](https://github.com/clustermod/CEM3/issues/new) button in the top right corner. Add a descriptive title and complete the issue template.

A video of the issue might be helpful in resolving it faster.

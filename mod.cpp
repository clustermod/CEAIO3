overview = "Cluster Enhanced: Movement (CEM3) is an Arma 3 addon that allows for more fine tuned control over movement speed. It takes heavy inspiration from the popular game Escape from Tarkov by Battlestate Games, and should be familiar to anyone who has played Escape from Tarkov previously. The mod also sports an entirely new optional modular UI to visualize the players current speed and stance similar to the one used in Escape from Tarkov.";
